The repository is organized into several key directories:
- configurations/: Contains configuration files, possibly for environment settings or test data.

documents/: Houses supporting documents such as:

  Test Plan
  Manual Test Cases
  Defect Log

pages/: Implements the Page Object Model (POM), encapsulating web elements and actions for different pages.

reports/: Stores test execution reports, particularly HTML reports generated by pytest.

test/: Contains test scripts that execute various test scenarios.

utility/: Includes utility functions, such as alert handling, to support test execution.

ðŸ§ª Test Execution
To run the tests and generate an HTML report, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
pytest --html=reports/result.html
This command executes all tests and outputs the results to an HTML file located in the reports/ directory.

ðŸ§° Key Features
Python & Selenium Integration: Utilizes Selenium WebDriver for browser automation and Python for scripting.

Pytest Framework: Employs pytest for structuring and executing test cases.

Page Object Model (POM): Enhances maintainability by separating page-specific actions and elements into dedicated classes.

Comprehensive Documentation: Provides detailed documents for test planning, manual test cases, and defect tracking.
